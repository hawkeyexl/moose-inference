# Architecture Decision Records

Behavior decisions in `@hawkeyexl/inference` ship with an ADR in
[MADR 4.0.0](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format — see the "Architecture Decision Records" section
of [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for when one is required and what it must contain.

- Filename: `NNNNN-kebab-case-title.md`, 5-digit zero-padded.
- Numbering starts at `01000`. The range `00001`–`00999` is reserved for backfilling pre-existing
  decisions inherited from the source projects (docevals ADR 01001's ensemble semantics, for
  instance) if and when that becomes useful.

| ADR | Title |

| [01005](01005-docset-strategy-and-executable-examples.md) | A CUJ-first documentation set, with samples that CI executes |
| [01006](01006-documenting-failure-and-orchestration.md) | Document failure and orchestration, and gate both against the source |
| [01007](01007-harden-two-operational-failure-paths.md) | Harden two operational failure paths: non-JSON CLI output, and an unsupported Node |
| [01008](01008-auto-install-the-local-runtime.md) | Auto-install the local runtime into a library-owned prefix, and refuse a model without a provider |
| [01009](01009-retier-the-local-model-catalog-by-measurement.md) | Choose the local model tiers by measuring this library's own task, not by published benchmarks |
| [01010](01010-restore-the-grammar-omitted-open-brace.md) | Restore the opening brace grammar-constrained generation omits, so the local provider works at all |
