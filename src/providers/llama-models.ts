/**
 * Curated GGUF models for the in-process `llama-cpp` provider, plus the
 * selector-to-model resolution that sits in front of them.
 *
 * The three tiers were chosen by measurement, not by published benchmark:
 * 26 real documentation pages with their `title` and `description` removed,
 * refilled through this library under a JSON Schema, and scored against the
 * human-written originals. See ADR 01009 for the numbers and the method.
 *
 * Two results from that run shape this catalog:
 *
 * 1. **Quality barely tracks size on schema-constrained extraction.** Every
 *    model between 1.4 GB and 5.5 GB scored within one standard error of the
 *    others. The tiers therefore buy latency and headroom for richer schemas
 *    than that corpus exercises — they do not buy a linear quality gain, and
 *    should not be described as if they do.
 * 2. **Latency stability does not track size either, and matters more.** Two
 *    builds ran away on long pages, generating until they hit a timeout rather
 *    than closing the JSON: Gemma 4 E2B at Q2 (6 of 12 pages unfinished at
 *    120s, one still going at 400s) and Granite 4.1 8B at Q4 (6 of 26 pages
 *    over 20s, three over 115s). Both are excluded from the tiers for that
 *    reason alone. A tier entry has to terminate.
 *
 * That is why the tiers are no longer one family. Chat templates now differ
 * across tiers, which is fine — node-llama-cpp reads the template out of each
 * GGUF — but it does mean a prompt tuned against one tier is not automatically
 * tuned against the next.
 *
 * The superseded Gemma aliases are kept, untiered, because consumers pin them
 * by name; dropping an alias is a hard failure rather than a slower download.
 *
 * Entries pin an exact blob path rather than a `:QUANT` tag. That is a hard
 * requirement, not a style preference, and it holds for every entry:
 *
 * - A tag can be re-pointed upstream, which silently changes the weights
 *   behind a cache key that already names the model. A pinned path cannot.
 *   This reason alone is sufficient, and it applies to all repos.
 * - Most of these repos carry `mmproj-*.gguf` (the ~1 GB vision projector)
 *   and some carry `mtp-*.gguf` beside the weights, which text-only judging
 *   must not download.
 * - On the Gemma QAT repos a tag would not resolve at all: they ship NO
 *   Q4_K_M, only UD-Q4_K_XL and UD-Q2_K_XL.
 *
 * Note the last point is specific to the Gemma QAT repos, which now back only
 * untiered entries. The Qwen3.5 and Granite repos behind the three tiers DO
 * publish Q4_K_M, so a tag would resolve there — and would still be wrong, for
 * the first reason. Do not read "the tag resolves" as "the tag is allowed".
