/**
 * Installing the optional `node-llama-cpp` peer on demand.
 *
 * Detection ends at `llama-cpp` precisely because it needs no key and no
 * account — but that rung is only reachable if the native binding is present,
 * and npm does not install optional peers. Without this module a machine with
 * no credentials and no binding falls off the end of the chain, which is the
 * one case auto-detection exists to serve.
 *
 * The install goes into a directory this library OWNS — never the consumer's
 * `node_modules`, `package.json` or lockfile. That is the same reasoning ADR
 * 01003 applied to weights: owning a directory removes the hazard instead of
 * defending against it. A consumer's dependency manifest is theirs, and a
 * library that edits it has broken reproducible installs for everyone
 * downstream.
